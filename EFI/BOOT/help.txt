==  Tweaks for the boot commandline ==

To boot with default values just press ENTER.

=== Desktop Environment ===

0|1|2|3|4|5|6|S|s|single => Select a runlevel to start with. 
  The default is 4 for graphical login. 
 
kbd=fr xkb=ch,fr => Example of custom X keyboard layout.
 
livepw="somestring" => Change the password for user "live".

locale=nl_NL kbd=nl tz=Europe/Amsterdam => Example of language, 
  keyboard and/or timezone customization. 
 
rootpw="somestring" => Change the password for user "root".

=== Custom software ===

load=nvidia => Load and configure Nvidia drivers if available 
  in the ISO. 
 
load=mod1[,mod2[...]] => Load one or more squashfs modules
  from the directory: "/liveslak/optional".
  By default none of these modules is loaded on boot.

noload=mod1[,mod2[...]] => Prevent loading of one or more
  squashfs modules from the directory "/liveslak/addons".
  By default all these modules are loaded on boot.

=== Network boot ===

dhcpwait=<numseconds> => Maximum wait time for the DHCP client to
  configure a network interface (default: 20 seconds).

nfsroot=ip.ad.dr.ess:/path/to/liveslak => defines the IP address
  of the NFS server, and the path to the extracted content
  of Slackware Live Edition.

nic=<driver>:<interface>:<dhcp|static>[:ipaddr:netmask[:gateway]]
  => network device customization, usually this parameter is
  not needed when your network runs a DHCP server.
  Specify a driver if UDEV does not detect the device. Specify the
  interface if Slackware Live can not figure it out. If you specify
  'static' you need to also specify ipaddr and netmask. The gateway
  is optional but needed to access the internet for instance.

=== Hardware related ===

localhd => initialize RAID/LVM on local hard drives.

tweaks=tweak1[,tweak2,[,...]] => Implemented tweaks:
  nga - no glamor 2D acceleration, avoids error "EGL_MESA_drm_image required".
  tpb - enable TrackPoint scrolling while holding down middle mouse button.
  syn - start the syndaemon for better support of Synaptics touchpads.

nomodeset => Boot without kernel mode setting, needed with 
  some machines. 
 
rootdelay=10 => Add 10 second delay to give the kernel more 
  time to initialize USB. Try this if booting fails. Default is 5.

swap => Allow the Live OS to activate all swap partitions on
  the local hardware. By default, no swap is touched.

=== Media tweaks ===

cfg=[skip|write] =>
  Specify 'skip' to skip disk-based configuration file containing
  OS parameters; or specify 'write' to write current OS parameters
  to disk.

hostname=your_custom_hostname[,qualifier] =>
  Specify a custom hostname.  A qualifier 'fixed' can be appended
  to prohibit hostname modification in  case of network boot.

livemedia=/dev/sdX => Tell the init script which partition
  contains the Slackware Live OS you want to boot. This can
  become necessary if you have another copy of Slackware Live
  installed in another partition.

livemedia=/dev/sdX:/path/to/live.iso => Use this if you want to
  load the live OS from an ISO file on a local harddisk partition.

livemain=directoryname => Use this if you copied the content
  of the ISO to a different directory than "liveslak".

luksvol=file1[:/mountpoint1][,file1[:/mountpoint2],...] =>
  Mount LUKS container "file1" at mount point "/mountpoint1".
  Multiple files should be separated with comma.
  Specify "luksvol=" to *prevent* mounting any LUKS container.

nop => No persistence, i.e. boot the virgin installation in 
  case your "persistence" directory got corrupted. 
 
persistence=directoryname => Use this if you want to use
  a different directory than "persistence" for storing
  persistent data.

toram => copy the OS from the media to to RAM before running it.
  You can remove the boot media after booting.

=== Troubleshooting ===

blacklist=mod1[,mod2[...]]  => Add one or more kernel modules
  to the kernel blacklist to prevent them from loading, in case
  they cause issues during operation.

debug => During init, pause at strategic locations while as-
  sembling the overlay filesystem and show mount information.

rescue => After initialization, you will be dropped in a
  rescue shell to perform lowlevel maintenance.
